A Checklist tool that serves as your own "Blog Entry Coach"

== Description ==

It's easy to accumulate a lot of web bookmarks to Top-10 Blog Tips, or Books/Ebooks on how to engage a reader with your writing. 

However It's another story to actually implement these principles into your day to day blogging, ( especially when you get caught up taking time on the Non-Writing mechanics of how to SEO-ize your site, how to improve the look of your Theme, etc..)

I wrote Good Writer Checkify to provide for an in-your-face kind of reminder, as you write each post, to nudge you to improve the *Content* itself.  

The Key is to You go back to all your saved web articles, books, etc.. and pick 10 of the best blogging principles and insert them into this Plugin's settings, so that you can check them off as your write each blog entry.  Of course, you can just start fresh if you have no bookmarked articles and just Google for Writing/Blogging Tips.

== Installation ==


* You can use Zip-uploader feature if your version of Wordpress has it

2. In your Admin, Go to Plugins/ Add New / and then click Upload from the choices .. browse for the Zip that you downloaded
3. Click Activate

* OR do it the manual way:

1. Download and extract the Plugin zip file.
2. Upload the folder containing the Plugin files to your WordPress Plugins folder (usually ../wp-content/plugins/ folder).
3. Activate the Plugin via the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Once activated you go to the Plugin options by clicking the 'Good Writer Checkfiy' link under the 'Settings' menu.
5. You then enter in up to 10 Reminder/Guidelines into the text inputs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does there have to be 10 items.. I only need about 5 =
No, as few as you need. In the Settings page, if you fill out only 5 of the item boxes, only 5 will show in your Post Editing Page.

= Do the checkboxes get saved anywhere, or are they just there for the visual reminder purpose =
Yes, this is really the main benefit of Good Writer Checkify.  Each individual Blog entry gets its own separate checklist .. i.e. each Blog Entry remembers how many of the "check points" have been satisfied.

= So even if I have 2 or 3 un-published Drafts In-progress at the same time.. the checked Checkboxes remain unique to each post ? =
Yes

= Why is that the checkbox's sometimes don't seem to be saved when I click on Save Draft ?  =
  This plugin requires that you at least put something - even just a couple of characters as a beginning - in the Title box, before clicking Save Draft, so that it knows it's saving a unique blog entry.

= I'd like to just use the blog check-off items that I see in the screenshots =
Okay, just open the sample_blog_guidelines.txt file in the root of this plugin's directory.


== Screenshots ==

1. The Good Writer Checkify Meta-Box, sitting conveniently under the post editor prompt you in meeting all or most of the guidelines.

2. You can turn off the checkmarks if you'd rather just have the reminders there as a reference, and not to necessarily actively check off.
